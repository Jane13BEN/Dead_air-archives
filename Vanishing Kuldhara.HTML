          Kuldhara was once a thriving village inhabited by the Paliwal
          Brahmins, a prosperous and intelligent community known for their
          agricultural and trade skills. However, in the early 1800s, something
          strange happened—the entire population vanished overnight. According
          to legend, Salim Singh, a cruel and powerful minister of Jaisalmer,
          developed an obsession with the village chief’s daughter. He demanded
          to marry her and threatened the villagers with heavy taxes if they
          refused. Rather than surrender to his tyranny, the entire
          population—consisting of nearly 1,500 people from Kuldhara and nearby
          villages—allegedly disappeared in a single night. Before leaving, they
          cursed the village, declaring that no one would ever be able to settle
          there again. To this day, Kuldhara remains uninhabited, with locals
          believing it is haunted.
