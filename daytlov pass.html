          In January 1959, Igor Dyatlov, a 23-year-old engineering student, led
          a group of nine experienced hikers on a skiing expedition into the
          Ural Mountains of the Soviet Union. Their goal: to reach Otorten
          Mountain, a remote and dangerous trek in deep winter conditions. The
          team consisted of university students and seasoned mountaineers, all
          prepared for extreme weather.

        <p>
          But something happened that night—something that turned their
          adventure into one of history’s most chilling cold-case mysteries.

        <h2>The Final Camp</h2>
        <p>
          On February 1, 1959, the group set up camp on the slopes of Kholat
          Syakhl—known as "Dead Mountain" in the local Mansi language. Instead
          of taking shelter in a nearby forest, they decided to pitch their tent
          on the open mountainside. That night, something terrified them so much
          that they cut open their tent from the inside and fled half-dressed
          into the freezing cold.

        <h2>The Discovery</h2>
        <p>
          When the hikers failed to return, a search party was sent out. On
          February 26, rescuers found the group’s abandoned tent. It was slashed
          open from the inside. Their belongings—boots, jackets, food—remained
          untouched. But the hikers were gone.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Barefoot tracks led away from the tent.</li>
          <li>Two bodies were found near a burned-out fire, half-naked.</li>
          <li>
            Three more bodies were discovered between the fire and the tent,
            frozen in positions that suggested they were crawling back.
          </li>
          <li>
            Two months later, the last four bodies were found deep in a ravine
            with severe injuries.

          <li>One hiker was missing her tongue and eyes.</li>

        <article>
          <h3>Avalanche Theory</h3>
          <p>
            A sudden small slab avalanche may have forced them to flee in panic.
            But no major avalanche signs were found.

          <h3>Military Testing</h3>
          <p>
            Some believe the group stumbled into a Soviet military experiment.
            Strange orange lights were reported in the sky that night.

        <article>
          <h3>Infrasound Panic</h3>
          <p>
            Strong winds could have created low-frequency sound waves that
            caused extreme fear, forcing them to flee into the cold.

          <h3>Paranormal & UFOs</h3>
          <p>
            Others speculate about unexplained forces, given the strange
            injuries and glowing orbs reported by other hikers.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          More than 60 years later, the Dyatlov Pass Incident remains unsolved.
          The official explanation states an avalanche caused their deaths, but
          many remain unconvinced. What really happened that night in the
          mountains? The answer may never be known.
