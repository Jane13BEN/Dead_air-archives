      <p>
        Spontaneous Human Combustion (SHC) refers to the phenomenon where a
        person is reported to have caught fire and burned to death without any
        obvious external ignition source. This rare and mysterious event has
        puzzled researchers and the public for centuries. While there have been
        many reported cases of SHC, the phenomenon remains scientifically
        unexplained.

          at the Cecil Hotel in Los Angeles. Before her death, eerie elevator
          footage of her acting strangely became viral, leading to numerous
