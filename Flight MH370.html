    On March 8, 2014, Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 took off from Kuala Lumpur International Airport bound for Beijing, China. The flight, carrying 239 passengers and crew members, was on a routine journey. The Boeing 777-200 aircraft was expected to be in the air for about six hours, but it never reached its destination.
  </p>
  <p>
    The aircraft lost contact with air traffic control less than an hour into its flight, and its transponder was mysteriously turned off. After that, the planeâ€™s whereabouts would remain unknown for months.

  <h2>The Search Begins</h2>
  <p>
    As soon as it was realized that Flight MH370 was missing, an extensive search operation was launched. Initial focus was on the South China Sea, where the aircraft was last known to be. However, this quickly expanded across the Indian Ocean after satellite data revealed the aircraft had veered off course.

    <li>In March 2014, satellite data suggested the plane flew for several hours after losing contact.</li>
    <li>Over the following months, debris from the aircraft was found washed up on the shores of islands in the Indian Ocean, but the main wreckage was never located.</li>

    <h3>The Hijacking Theory</h3>

      One theory is that the plane was hijacked, possibly by someone on board. The fact that the plane flew for several hours after losing contact raises questions about a potential deliberate diversion.

    <h3>The Mechanical Failure Theory</h3>
    <p>
      Some experts believe that a mechanical failure, such as a sudden decompression, caused the plane to lose control. This theory suggests the crew might have tried to regain control of the aircraft, but ultimately failed.

    <h3>The Pilot Theory</h3>

    <h3>The Alien or Paranormal Theory</h3>
    <p>
      Some have even speculated that the plane's disappearance is due to paranormal or extraterrestrial forces. While this is considered highly unlikely by experts, the mysterious nature of the disappearance has led to such theories gaining traction in popular culture.

  <h2>The Ongoing Mystery</h2>
  <p>
    Despite extensive search efforts, the final location of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 remains unknown. In 2018, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) concluded that the plane likely crashed somewhere along the "7th arc," an area of the Indian Ocean. However, the main wreckage has never been found, and the cause of the plane's disappearance remains one of the greatest mysteries of the 21st century.
  </p>
  <p>
    More than six years later, families of the passengers and the world continue to search for answers, as the mystery of Flight MH370 endures.
